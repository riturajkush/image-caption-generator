# Image/Video Caption Generators
Image captioning implemented in TensorFlow and Keras

This repository is an attempt at creating a fully deployable image/video captioning service.

- The image captioning in Keras is inspired by the tutorial by Jason Brownlee: https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/ and the paper "Where to put the Image in an Image Caption Generator": https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09137
- The image captioning in Tensorflow is inspired Raul Puri and Daniel Ricciardelli's article: https://www.oreilly.com/learning/caption-this-with-tensorflow, on adaption of the "Show and Tell" model: https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555
